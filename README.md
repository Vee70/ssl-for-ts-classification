PyTorch implementation of "Self-Supervised Representation Learning for Time Series Classification".


## Requirements

Experiments were done with Python 3.12.4 with the following libraries:
* numpy==2.2.6
* pandas==2.3.1
* ptwt==1.0.0
* pywavelet==1.9.0
* scikit-learn==1.6.1
* scipy==1.15.3
* torch==2.6.0


## Datasets

The datasets can be obtained from [Series2Vec](https://github.com/Navidfoumani/Series2Vec). Create a `datasets/` folder then move the data into the folder.
